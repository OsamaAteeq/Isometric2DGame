# Isometric2DGame
RunicDicesTask

This project is to show case that an applicant can do ~basic~ tasks in Unity (I am the applicant :D)
Features includes all tasks plus bonuses that I implemented (I may have missed to mention something, but I don't think I have)

# Features
Task 2
-
> New Input System integration for player controls  
> Isometric diagonal movement with WASD/arrow keys (NE, NW, SE, SW)  
> Rigidbody2D-based smooth player movement and collision setup  
> Cinemachine isometric camera that follows the player  
> Configurable player speed and instant acceleration  
> Basic player animations via color and sprite transformations  
> Environment obstacles affecting movement 

Task 3
-
> Basic enemy character with placeholder sprite  
> AI state machine with Idle, Patrol, Chase, and Attack states  
> State transitions triggered by player detection and proximity  
> Enemy chases player within detection range and attacks when close  
> Dynamic patrol routes with randomizable patrol points  
> Debug messages for attack state feedback  
> Advanced pathfinding with NavMesh for obstacle avoidance 

Task 4.3
-
> Basic dialogue system with NPC-player conversations  
> Dialogue triggered by proximity and key press (E - Interaction key set in the new input system)  
> Multi-step dialogue progression  
> Branching dialogue options with multiple player responses and outcomes  
> Custom Visual graph-based editor using XNode for connecting dialogue nodes and creating a Conversation  
> Support for multiple NPCs each with unique dialogue sequences  
> Dialogue UI implemented with Unity Canvas for dynamic text and choices display
